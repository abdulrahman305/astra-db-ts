Tons of new typing

Removed `collection.count()` (as it was deprecated)

Gave truly private methods the `private` modifier
- Not sure if I should do them for the fields?

Gave unimplemented/unsupported methods a type-level type error to force compile-time breakage (using unique string types)

Refactored `cursor.count()` to depend on `cursor.toArray()` and for the latter to use `executeOperation()`
- Why was `.count()` using `executeOperation()` before but not `.toArray()`??

Made some of the `Cursor` class fields directly initialized

Added error to `Client` constructor when `applicationToken` isn't supplied

Removed args from `collection.distinct()`

Changed a lot of `ts-ignore`s to `ts-expect-error`s

Removed tests (such as `createDatabase`) which are unconditionally skipped

Added `$vectorize` in `SortOptions`

Removed specific error message testing
- Changed field length test to 1000+

Made `db.createCollection()` return a `Collection<Schema>` like it does w/ Mongoose
- Updated collection test to check name of collection instead of `status.ok`
- Made it throw an error on failure

Same with `db.dropCollection` returning a `boolean`

Changed tests to just delete everything in the collection instead of the collection itself
- Seems to be much faster and no different?

Merged in new stargate fix for http2 timeouts
- http-client code is getting messy thoughâ€”will probably refactor if we decide to go through with http+http2 support

Heavily refactored HTTPClient as it was getting large, messy, & divergent
- Abstracted out HTTP1.1/2.0 differences into different strategies
- Moved out constants & types
- Made HTTP2 properly support query params & methods like HTTP1 did (even though they aren't used, it saves potential future bugs)
- renamed `httpClient.ts` to `http-client.ts` to match the rest of the files

Added `listCollections` to `Db` class
- Added three tess for it, testings behaviors for `nameOnly`
- Added it to `Client` since that seems to be a trend

Rename `executeOperation` to `withErrorLogging`

Moved `AstraDB` to `astra.ts` & typed it

Added `insertManyBulk` to `Collection` class
- Added tests for it
