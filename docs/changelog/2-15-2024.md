Added new features from stargate-mongoose to astra-db-ts
- Most importantly, http2 support [(more info)](https://github.com/stargate/stargate-mongoose/commit/4d794590821e9148c38980042c97293d82733ff7?diff=split&w=0)
- ^ did change implementation slightly, but all tests are passing fine
- ^ biggest change is that instead of `keyspaceName` and `collectionName` being passed in `executeCommand`,
- ^ the client is just shallow-cloned w/ new keyspace/collection name when needed

Upgraded Typescript to a newer version

Removed `bson` dependency

Added explicit resource management support for Clients
- https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management
- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-2.html
- Added test in `client.ts` to test ERM (`'automatically disconnects when out of scope w/ ERM'`)

Why does stargate-mongoose, when running tests in parallel w/ a singular shared client, not have issues with the clients closing
prematurely???
- changed `testClient.client` to become `testClient.new()` so each file has its own instance

Some more formatting/linting fixes here and there

Made `'Should fail insert of doc over size 1 MB'` just test for an error (as I'm some html 413 response instead of an actual JSON response?)

Changed some error names
- Removed `StargateAstraError` as it was only used once to represent an unsupported operation

Some other minor changes or stuff I forgot about
