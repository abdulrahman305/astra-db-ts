Tons of new typing

Removed `collection.count()` (as it was deprecated)

Gave truly private methods the `private` modifier
- Not sure if I should do them for the fields?

  Gave unimplemented/unsupported methods a type-level type error to force compile-time breakage (using unique string types)

Refactored `cursor.count()` to depend on `cursor.toArray()` and for the latter to use `executeOperation()`
- Why was `.count()` using `executeOperation()` before but not `.toArray()`??

Made some of the `Cursor` class fields directly initialized

Added error to `Client` constructor when `applicationToken` isn't supplied

Removed args from `collection.distinct()`

Changed a lot of `ts-ignore`s to `ts-expect-error`s

Removed tests (such as `createDatabase`) which are unconditionally skipped

Removed `e2e` test folder as I don't think it was doing anything? Can easily readd if necessary
